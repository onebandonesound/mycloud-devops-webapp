This guide walks through setting up a three-tier architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS), a
common approach for designing scalable, reliable, and secure applications. This model
separates an application into three logical or physical layers:
• Presentation Tier: The user interface for interacting with the application, typically
accessed on personal devices via web browsers using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
• Application Tier: This layer processes logic and handles communication between the
user interface and the database. It executes the core application functions and is
developed using programming languages like Python, Java, or PHP.
• Database Tier: This layer stores and manages data, using a database management
system for retrieval and processing.

Benefits of a Three-Tier Architecture
1.
Scalability: Each tier can be scaled independently to manage varying workloads.
2.
Reliability: Isolating tiers enhances system stability; issues in one tier won’t directly impact the others.
3.
Security: By separating tiers onto different servers, sensitive data and operations are more secure.
4.
Cost Efficiency: Resources can be allocated based on the needs of each tier, optimizing costs.
Prerequisites
•
An active AWS account.
•
Command Line Interface (CLI) access.
Use Case: As a cloud engineer for Cloud_create, you are tasked with designing a high-availability, three-tier architecture for a web application. This architecture will handle customer requests, process application logic, and store product and customer information in the database.
